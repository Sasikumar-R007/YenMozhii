COMPLETE FIX - FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:

1. REMOVE Demo FOLDER FROM GIT:
   git rm -r --cached Demo
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Remove Demo folder from repository"
   git push origin main

2. WAIT 2-3 minutes, then deploy on Vercel

3. The Demo folder is now ignored and won't be included in builds
